## RPG Plugin (WIP)

The RPG Plugin currently allows a user to generate a character if they don't already have one as well as fight a randomly generated monster. When a monster is defeated, the player gains XP and will potentially level up. If a user is defeated, their player is permanently deleted and stored for future leader board purposes.

* rpg2.fight — generate a random monster for the player to fight.
* rpg2.potion — use one of your players potion if one is available and you aren't already full hp.
* rpg2.freepotion — check if you have a free potion available, players may take one every 20 minutes.
* rpg2.leaders — check the current leaderboards for all living characters.
